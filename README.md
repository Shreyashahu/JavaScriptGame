# Simon Says Game

This repository contains the implementation of a classic "Simon Says" game, built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game challenges players to remember and replicate a sequence of button presses.

## How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the buttons flash in a specific sequence.
3. Click the buttons in the same order as they flash.
4. If you correctly follow the sequence, the level increases, and the sequence becomes longer.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score is displayed.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay:** The sequence becomes longer as you progress.
- **Visual Feedback:** Buttons flash to indicate the sequence and user actions.
- **Game Over Screen:** Displays the final score and resets the game for a new attempt.

## Code Explanation

### Main Components

- **Variables:**
  - `gameSeq`: Stores the sequence of colors generated by the game.
  - `userSeq`: Stores the sequence of colors clicked by the user.
  - `btns`: Array of button colors (`["red", "yellow", "green", "blue"]`).
  - `started`: Tracks whether the game has started.
  - `level`: Tracks the current level.

- **Functions:**
  - `gameFlash(btn)`: Flashes a button in the sequence.
  - `userFlash(btn)`: Flashes a button when clicked by the user.
  - `levelUp()`: Generates the next step in the sequence and updates the level.
  - `checkAns(idx)`: Checks if the user's input matches the game's sequence.
  - `btnPress()`: Handles button clicks from the user.
  - `reset()`: Resets the game state after a game over.

### Event Listeners

- **Keyboard Input:** Starts the game when any key is pressed.
- **Button Clicks:** Listens for user clicks on the color buttons.

### Game Logic

- A random button is chosen at each level and added to `gameSeq`.
- The user must replicate the sequence stored in `gameSeq` using button clicks.
- If the user makes a mistake, the game displays the final score and resets.
